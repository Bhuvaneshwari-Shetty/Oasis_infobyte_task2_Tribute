            Swami Vivekananda (1863â€“1902) was a Hindu monk, philosopher, and spiritual leader who played a key role in introducing Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world.

            This event marked his introduction to the global stage.<br><br>
            Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission to promote the principles of service, renunciation, and spiritual knowledge.
            His writings, including works like "Raja Yoga" and "Karma Yoga," continue to inspire people seeking spiritual growth and a deeper understanding of life's purpose.<br><br>
            Swami Vivekananda's legacy endures as a source of inspiration for individuals on a quest for spiritual enlightenment and those interested in the integration of diverse religious and philosophical traditions.
            His teachings remain relevant in the contemporary world, fostering a message of unity, love, and the realization of the divinity within each individual.
